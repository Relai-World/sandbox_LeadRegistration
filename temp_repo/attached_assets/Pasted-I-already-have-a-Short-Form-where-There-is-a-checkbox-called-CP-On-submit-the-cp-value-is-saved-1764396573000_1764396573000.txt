I already have a Short Form where:

There is a checkbox called CP.

On submit, the cp value is saved into both:

public."Unverified_Properties"

public.unified_data

Now I have a Full Form used when editing an existing project.

New Requirement

When I click “Edit” on any project:

It redirects to the Full Form (edit page).

On the Full Form:

The CP checkbox should be pre-filled with the previously saved value from the Short Form.

That means:

If cp is true in the database, the CP checkbox should be checked.

If cp is false or null, the CP checkbox should be unchecked.

When I update the Full Form and click Submit:

The cp value should again be saved to both:

public."Unverified_Properties"

public.unified_data

Using the same key (preferably id or rera_number) that is passed from the Short Form / project list.

What I need you to generate

Please:

Explain and implement the navigation flow:

From project list / Short Form:

On “Edit” click, navigate to the Full Form route with the project identifier (e.g. /projects/[id]/full or similar).

Show example code for the button / link that triggers this navigation with the correct id or rera_number.

Full Form component (React + TypeScript):

On mount, read the project identifier from the route params.

Fetch the corresponding row from public."Unverified_Properties" (and/or unified_data if needed).

Initialize React state for all form fields, including cp.

Bind a CP checkbox to this state:

Checked state reflects cp from the database.

Toggling the checkbox updates the cp state.

Supabase queries:

Code to fetch the existing project by id or rera_number for pre-filling the Full Form, including cp.

Code to update both:

public."Unverified_Properties"

public.unified_data

Ensure the same cp value is written to both tables.

Handle errors gracefully and show an error message in the UI.

Show a loading state while data is being fetched and while the form is being submitted.

TypeScript & UX details:

Use proper TypeScript types/interfaces for:

The project data (including cp).

The form state.

Disable the submit button while saving.

Optionally show a success message or redirect back after successful submit.

Final output:

Provide:

The Edit button/link code (where I click “Edit” on a project).

The Full Form React component with:

Data fetching

State management (including cp)

CP checkbox

Submit handler that updates both tables.

All Supabase calls (fetch + update) in a clean, production-ready format
